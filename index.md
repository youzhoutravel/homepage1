## About Me

I am a theorist working in quantum information and computing, at Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves, Fudan Unvi.. I got my B.S. from Zhejiang Univ. in 2014, and Ph.D. from Tsinghua Univ. in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Xiongfeng Ma. I have also been working with Prof. Alioscia Hamma from that time. I did my PostDoc with Prof. Arthur Jaffe at Harvard Univ., and Prof. Mile Gu at Nanyang Technological University & Centre for Quantum Technologies, Singapore.

## Research Interests
Currently my research is on the following two aspects: 1. **quantum correlations**: especially multipartite entanglment and quantum magic; 2. **learning and benchmarking of quantum systems**: especially randomized measurements and shadow estimation. I am also interested in the application of these two aspects to **quantum information scrambling** and **quantum simulation algorithms**. 

## Publications
