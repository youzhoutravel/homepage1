## About Me

I am a theorist working in quantum information and computing at Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves, Fudan Unvi.. I got my B.Eng. from Zhejiang univ in 2014, and Ph.D. from Tsinghua Univ. in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Xiongfeng Ma . I have also been working with Prof. Alisocia Hamma from that time. I did my PostDoc with Prof. Arthur Jaffe at Harvard Univ., and Prof. Mile Gu at Nanyang Technological University & Centre for Quantum Technologies.

Currently I mainly focus on the following two aspects: 1. quantum correlations: especailly multipartite entanglment and quantum magic; 2. Learning and benchmarking of quantum systems: especailly randomized measurements and shadow estimation. I am also interested in the application of these two aspects to related problems in quantum information scrambling and quantum simulation algorithms.
