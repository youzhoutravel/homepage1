## About Me

I am a theorist working in quantum information and computing, at Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves, Fudan Univ. I got my B.S. from Zhejiang Univ. in 2014, and my Ph.D. from Tsinghua Univ. in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. [Xiongfeng Ma](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/maxiongfeng/). I have also worked with Prof. [Alioscia Hamma](https://www.quantumphysics.fun/) since then. I did my PostDoc with Prof. [Arthur Jaffe](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Univ., and Prof. [Mile Gu](https://www.quantumcomplexity.org/milegu/) at Nanyang Technological University & Centre for Quantum Technologies, SG.

## Research Interests
I enjoy thinking about problems at the intersection of quantum information and quantum many-body physics, so I call my research 'quantum many-bit info'. I like to tackle physics-motivated problems with a mathematical-rigorous approach.
My current research focuses on **learning and benchmarking of quantum systems**, especially randomized measurements and shadow estimation. 

**Keywords: many-body entanglement, quantum (pseudo-)randomness, quantum dynamics**


## Publications
All of my works are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=oQ_tbtYAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate).
