## About Me

I am a theorist working in quantum information and computing at Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves, Fudan Unvi.. I got my B.Eng. from Zhejiang univ in 2014, and Ph.D. from Tsinghua Univ. in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Xiongfeng Ma . I have also been working with Prof. Alioscia Hamma from that time. I did my PostDoc with Prof. Arthur Jaffe at Harvard Univ., and Prof. Mile Gu at Nanyang Technological University & Centre for Quantum Technologies, Singapore.

## Research Interests
Currently my research is on the following two aspects: 1. **quantum correlations**: especailly multipartite entanglment and quantum magic; 2. **Learning and benchmarking of quantum systems**: especailly randomized measurements and shadow estimation. I am also interested in the application of these two aspects to related problems in **quantum information scrambling** and **quantum simulation algorithms**. 

## News
- **[Dec. 2022]** Our work on [multi-shot shadow estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11068.pdf) is posted.
- **[Sep. 2022]** My first graduate student Zhou You joins (yes, his name is conjugate to mine, not a mistake)!
- **[Aug. 2022]** Our work on [hybrid shadow estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08416) is posted.
- **[Jul. 2022]** Dr. Qing Liu from NTU, SG joins!
- **[Feb. 2022]** I join in Fudan Unvi. and life at SH begins!

## Hobbies
